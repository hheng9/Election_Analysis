# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.

### The purpose of this election audit analysis is to calculate the votes by counties, candidates, turnover, totals, and percentages. The data collected from our Python script created in Visual Studio Code will help generate itemized information on the winning amount of total votes and filter the results as needed.

## Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
  * The election resulted in 369,711 total votes across all counties
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Which county had the largest number of votes?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
